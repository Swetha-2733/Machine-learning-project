## Introduction

Predicting fire alarms can help improve response times and prevent damage by enabling proactive measures. This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to analyze sensor data and classify potential fire alarm events. By training on historical data, the model can make predictions based on environmental features like temperature, humidity, and smoke levels.

## Features

- **Predict fire alarms** using a trained Random Forest model.
- **Customizable** parameters for training the model to improve accuracy.
- **Model evaluation** with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Visualization tools** for data analysis and results.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fire-alarm-predictor.git
   cd fire-alarm-predictor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure Python is installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset:**
   - Place your dataset file in the `data/` folder.
   - Update the dataset path in the script or notebook as needed.

## Usage

1. **Training the Model:**
   Run the training script or open the Jupyter Notebook to train the model with your data:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook fire_alarm_prediction.ipynb
   ```

2. **Making Predictions:**
   Use the trained model to make predictions on new data by running:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input new_data.csv
   ```
   This will output the likelihood of a fire alarm based on the provided input features.

3. **Evaluate the Model:**
   You can evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation and other metrics provided in the notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project should contain features related to fire alarm prediction, such as:
- **Temperature**
- **Humidity**
- **Smoke levels**
- **CO2 concentration**
- **Other environmental factors**

You can adjust the code to fit your specific dataset by modifying the feature columns.

## Model Evaluation

This project includes various metrics to evaluate the model's performance, including:
- **Accuracy**
